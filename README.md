## Abstract
In this article, we study two challenging problems in semisupervised cross-view learning. On the one hand, most existing methods assume that the samples in all views have a pairwise relationship, that is, it is necessary to capture or establish the correspondence of different views at the sample level. Such an assumption is easily isolated even in the semisupervised setting wherein only a few samples have labels that could be used to establish the correspondence. On the other hand, almost all existing multiview methods, including semisupervised ones, usually train a model using a fixed dataset, which cannot handle the data of increasing views. In practice, the view number will increase when new sensors are deployed. To address the above two challenges, we propose a novel method that employs multiple independent semisupervised view-specific networks (ISVNs) to learn representation for multiple views in a view-decoupling fashion. The advantages of our method are two-fold. Thanks to our specifically designed autoencoder and pseudolabel learning paradigm, our method shows an effective way to utilize both the labeled and unlabeled data while relaxing the data assumption of the pairwise relationship, that is, correspondence. Furthermore, with our view decoupling strategy, the proposed ISVNs could be separately trained, thus efficiently handling the data of increasing views without retraining the entire model. To the best of our knowledge, our ISVN could be one of the first attempts to make handling increasing views in the semisupervised setting possible, as well as an effective solution to the noncorresponding problem. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments by comparing 13 state-of-the-art approaches on four multiview datasets in terms of retrieval and classification.

## Framework
<h4>Figure 1. Difference between (a) existing joint multiview learning and (b) our independent multiview learning. In brief, the traditional methods use all views to learn the common space. They are difficult to handle increasing views since their models are optimized depending on all views. Thus, they should retrain the whole model to handle new views, which is inefficient with abandoning the trained model. In contrast, our method independently trains the <i>k</i> view-specific models for the <i>k</i> new views, thus efficiently handling increasing views.</h4>

## Usage
To train a model for image modelity wtih 64 bits on $datasets, just run main_DCHN.py as follows:
```bash
python train_ISVN.py --datasets $datasets --epochs $epochs --batch_size $batch_size --view_id $view --output_shape $output_shape --beta $beta --alpha $alpha --threshold $threshold --K $K --gpu_id $gpu_id
```
where <font color=MediumOrchid>$datasets</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$epochs</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$batch_size</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$view</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$output_shape</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$beta</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$alpha</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$threshold</font>, <font color=MediumOrchid>$K</font>, and <font face="times" color=MediumOrchid>$gpu_id</font> are the name of dataset, epoch , batch size, view number, objective dimensionality, <i>Œ≤</i>, <i>Œ±</i>Ôºå<i>Œ≥</i>, the number of labeled data, and GPU ID, respectively.

To evaluate the trained models, you could run train_ISVN.py as follows:
```bash
python train_ISVN.py --mode eval --datasets $datasets --view -1 --output_shape $output_shape --beta $beta --alpha $alpha --K $K --gpu_id $gpu_id --num_workers 0
```
